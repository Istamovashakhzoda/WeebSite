                <p>Indeed’s <span>“Best Jobs of 2020”</span> ranked America’s most highly prized 
                    <br>
                    careers based on demand, pay, and potential for growth. Some of
                    <br>
                    these included: software architect (1), full-stack developer (2), Java 
                    <br>
                    developer (6), data scientist (7), and IT security specialist (9). That
                    <br>
                    means that of the top ten best jobs in America, half of them 
                    <br>
                    required coding skills.</p>
                    <br>
                     <p>But, if you don’t have coding skills, where do you go to learn them? 
                        <br>
                        Some may turn to their local library, and others may have the time 
                        <br>
                        and money to go back to school or a <span>coding bootcamp.</span></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Either way, you’re going to need to practice. Thanks to the
